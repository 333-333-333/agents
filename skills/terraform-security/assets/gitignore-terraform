# =============================================================================
# Terraform .gitignore patterns
# =============================================================================
# Add these to your project's .gitignore (root or infra-level).
# These protect secrets, state, and provider binaries from being committed.

# --- Provider plugins and modules cache ---
.terraform/

# --- State files (contain ALL resource attributes, including secrets) ---
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
*.tfstate.*.backup

# --- Variable files (contain actual secret values) ---
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json
!*.tfvars.example

# --- Lock file (optional — commit if you want reproducible builds) ---
# .terraform.lock.hcl

# --- Crash logs ---
crash.log
crash.*.log

# --- Plan files (may contain secrets) ---
*.tfplan

# --- Override files (local developer overrides) ---
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json
