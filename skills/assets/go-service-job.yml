# Go microservice CI job template.
#
# Standard 3-step pipeline: test -> build binary -> build Docker image.
#
# To adapt for a new Go service:
#   1. Replace `api-gateway` with your service name in job id, name, and if condition
#   2. Replace `api/gateway` with your service path in working-directory and setup-go paths
#   3. Replace the Docker image tag
#
# The Go version is pinned via go-version-file (reads from the service's go.mod),
# so you never have to update it manually in the workflow.
